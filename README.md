There's still a lot to do and I will be adding bits and pieces from time to time when I find a minute or two.

## Replacing the Backup Battery and restoring NVRAM Settings

If your scope is stuck on the splash screen of the TekScope application (see screenshot below), the most likely reason is that the memory contents of the NVRAM have been erased. Usually this is the case when the backup battery of said NVRAM located on the  the PowerPC Board (the lower of the two motherboards) has been depleted. This means that you have to replace the battery and restore the NVRAM setting. 

I've compiled a tutorial on how to do that here: [Replacing the Backup Battery and restoring NVRAM Settings](NVRAM/README.md)

I also created a bracket for installing 2.5" SSDs and HDDs: [3D printable SSD holder](3D%20printable%20SSD%20holder)
